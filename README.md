# subshift subtitle syncer

This is a new project, check back soon for updates.

Couldn't find a subtitle syncer I liked so I just wrote my own. Currently only .srt files are supported (.ass file support may be added in the future)

Main methods:

 - linear shift (increase/decrease delay)
 - linear mapping (given 2 source timestamps and 2 target timestamps, it will linearly stretch and shift them to match)
 - delay mapping (similar to linear mapping, except instead of 2 target timestamps, the subtitle delay correction value is given at two timestamps)

Other features supported:
 - sorting
 - reset method (if you wish to revert all changes made to the current sub)
 - read and write features (obviously)
 - slicing
 - head and tail to quickly view them

documentation will be added soon
